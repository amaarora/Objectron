# Objectron

> Objectron is being built in order to overcome Bounding Box augmentations in PyTorch. So far, pretty much all the libraries use OpenCV underneath apart from fastai. In this library, I will be extracting ideas from fastai, and creating a new library solely for the purpose of object detection and augmentation.


This file will become your README and also the index of your documentation.
